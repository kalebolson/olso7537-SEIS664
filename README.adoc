= node-svc, a microservice learning example

A simple Node microservice showing use of node-fetch and express with async logic. Calls itself recursively. 

Includes simplest possible Mocha/Chai test. Includes a variety of provisioning and configuration resources (shell, Terrform, Packer, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes) and basic Github Actions pipeline for testing, building, pushing to gcr.io, and deploying to Kubernetes. 

Not all scripts are executable; some are for reference only (e.g. logging.sh).
